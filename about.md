## Welcome to Patrick Bollinger's blog!

Hello, my name is Patrick and I am the creator of this blog. I created this blog to help relieve my thoughts about software, electronics, sociology, security, and anything else that may spike my interest.

For a little background, my profession is Electrical Engineering and I live in NE Ohio.
