Wow... it's been a while since I've done any programming. But this is it! The first post to my new blog. The first day of October. The first day of [Hacktoberfest by Digitial Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). The first day of my "100 Days of Code" challenge! 

Today, I haven't done a whole lot of coding though. Most time has been spent figuring out how to use my custom domain `pjbollinger.com` instead of `pjbollinger.github.io`, while still utilizing HTTPS. At the time of writing this post, Github does not support HTTPS when using a custom domain. It's a bummer when great services like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) will easily create SSL certificates for domains. Hopefully someday, Github will incorporate Let's Encrypt into their Github Pages servers, until that day comes we have to go around this limitation.

Luckily, I was able to find this [blog post by CloudFlare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/) detailing how to utilize their services to enable HTTPS while using my custom domain for this Github Page repository. The process was pretty straight-forward. It was interesting though learning a bit more about how to use a CDN like CloudFlare. I hope to gain more experience with CDNs in the future as I develop more applications.

I'm really looking forward to these Hacktoberfest activities though. **The T-shirt looks awesome** and is inspiring to get motivated. Now, I don't have much experience with open source projects. In order to get a free T-shirt you have to open 4 pull-requests. In the process of learning more about the activies I found a cool group [CodeBuddies](https://codebuddies.org), a service to help schedule hangouts for programming. All of their code is open source and they appear to be a very helpful group of people. I plan on looking through their open issues to see where I might be able to help.

Let the fun begin!
