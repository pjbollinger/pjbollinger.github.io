I wanted to get this post out earlier for Day 002 but no luck.

My wife and I were busy taking care of our Sunday activities, including attending a game development meetup.
Game development has always fascinated me and was the inspiration for me to pursue a career involving computers.
Throughout middle school, high school, and even college, buddies of mine have always thought, "Let's just make a game."
Grand stories were created for the background of our great heroes, but when we wanted to start development... it was hard.
Most game ideas died in the process of learning how to use a game engine.
Ambitions died; we moved on.

Now... game development is **AWESOME**.
As I was saying earlier, we attended a game development meetup.
At the meetup, we got to attend a workshop for character movement in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).
Prior to the meeting, I tried to run Unity and was presented with a daunting interface.
In 20 minutes, including silly mistakes of misspelling _location_, we were able to move a simple dot around the screen.
The two greatest things I gathered from this was: holy cow is it easy to get started and I want to do more now!
Attending this workshop was truly inspiring and made me realize the impact of achieving small bite-size goals.
Although I only programmed three lines of code, the experience and inspiration was quite motivational.

For any people just getting started with game development, I would recommend the following:

1. Download [Unity Personal Edition](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal)
2. Check out the [2D UFO Tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-ufo-tutorial)
3. Good job, you made a game!
